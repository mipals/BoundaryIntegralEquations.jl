We demonstrate that this unavoidable loss mechanism is not merely a refinement, but that it plays a dominant role in the actual acoustic response of the structure. Specifically, in the case of very narrow slits, the visco--thermal losses avoid completely the excitation of Fabry--Perot resonances, leading to 100% reflection. This is exactly opposite to the perfect transmission predicted in the idealised lossless case. Moreover, for a wide range of geometrical parameters, there exists an optimum slit width at which the energy dissipated in the structure can be as high as 50%. This work provides a clear evidence that visco--thermal effects are necessary to describe realistically the acoustic response of locally resonant metamaterials.},

  abstract = {Boundary Element Method frequency sweep analyses in acoustics are usually accompanied by a vast numerical cost of assembling and solving numerous linear systems. In that context, this work proposes a model order reduction technique to mitigate the resulting computational cost of such analyses. First, a series expansion of the Green’s function BEM kernel is leveraged to construct a series of frequency independent matrices. Next, in a model order reduction way, the arising matrices are projected on a reduced basis utilizing a Galerkin projection. By this off-line matrix projection, both the assembly and the solution of the BEM full-size linear systems degenerate into assembling and solving a reduced system for all frequencies. Significant speed-up factors can, thus, be achieved for both operations. The projection basis employed in this model reduction scheme is developed through an Arnoldi algorithm for the BEM systems on a grid of master frequencies. The method is based on Krylov subspaces recycling, as the subspaces produced at master frequencies are recycled to approximate the surface distribution of the acoustic variables on the whole frequency range of interest. Utilizing Krylov subspaces facilitates as well the definition of a robust error estimator that indicates the quality of the reduced system. The performance of the proposed method is assessed for both an exterior and an interior problem for a simple and more complicated geometry respectively.}
