This is a package provides the building blocks required for discretizing and solving (surface) integral equations using the techniques of the Boundary Element Method (BEM). The focus so far has been on the solution of the Kirchhoffâ€“Helmholtz integral equation found in acoustical applications. However, as the package provides an interface to various element is should be easy to extended to handle all kinds of
